# cc_charts

Here we present some tools for the exploratory analysis and visualization of the bioactivity spaces of the Chemical Checker. The space_charts directory contains the interactive plots depicting the functional areas that make up the spaces analysed in the paper. 

We have also included some use cases and an explanation on how to use the tool for creating molecule visualizations. These are available at use_case.html and the attached jupyter notebook.

# Usage

To download and run the jupyter notebook, please execute the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/angelmf97/cc_charts.git
cd cc_charts
conda create env -f env.yml
conda activate cc_charts
jupyter lab use_cases.ipynb
```
This will open a jupyter notebook, allowing you to run all the examples and generate your own visualizations.
