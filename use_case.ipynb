    "This objects allow us to better explore the data. Following the naming use in packages such as sklearn, these objects have a 'fit' method to train the instance, generating all the data needed for the visualizations. Unfortunately, this process is data-intensive and computationally very expensive, as it involves performing a Fisher's exact test for each feature for each of the molecules. In a big space such as B4 this involves doing this computation 2 billion times (631027 molecules by 4635 features), not to mention the amounts of memory needed to store the results. For such reasons, the code is designed ad hoc to be ran in our HPC facilities. Nonetheless, it is possible to generate the visualizations using preprocessed data. To generate molecule visualizations, we just need to run the 'predict' method, giving a query molecule. This query can be input as an InChI key, SMILES or molecule name. Here we will analyse Atenolol, a beta-blocking agent used to treat high blood pressure and heart-associated chest pain."

    "Calling this method generates a dataframe containing all the features enriched within the molecule's neighbourhood and a confidence score that are p-values transformed so they range from 0 to 1. It also produces an interactive figure showing the areas where these features are positively enriched, plus the position of the molecule and its neighbours. The legend is interactive allowing to choose which areas to display. You can also use the controls below the figure to pan, zoom in and out, and return to the original view. As shown, this molecule is contained by a region that is rich in beta-blocking agents, as itself. We can also take a look to the therapeutic areas and side effects that are enriched within its neighbourhood."
